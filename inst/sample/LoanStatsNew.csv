I want to payoff as much as possible and then close the CC accounts.  I know that closing the CC accounts may hurt my FICO a little in the short run, but I want to close them nevertheless.  Purpose of loan: Payoff highest-rate credit card debt, which is currently 28-31.5%.  Getting another loan with a lower interest rate will improve my monthly cashflow.  My progress:  Today I have 14 credit lines with a revolving credit balance of 150K and utilization of 99% (result of recently paying down 2 CC accounts anc closing them).   My financial situation:  I have accumulated too much credit card debt and continue to work to pay it all off.  I have a perfect payback history: no missed payments or delinquent accounts.  My payback history in my credit files is perfect, but I have let some credit card rates get too high by some inattention on my part.  I opened some credit cards with low introductory rates on balance transfers but because I was late on a couple of the payments by literally 1-3 days, the credit card companies jacked up the rates.  Those initial low interest rate offers (e.g., 0 to 3.99% for 12 months) for balance transfers were tempting, but came back to haunt me.  My credit rating/score looks poor becasue of my high percent of borrowing vs. limit.  I've always paid back and will continue to.  I have no delinquencies or negatives on my credit reports and I'm committed to it staying that way.  Any form of negative mark on my credit report is not an option for me.  If my loan is funded, I will immediately pay down my highest interest debt .  I'm fortunate to be in a situation where I'm earning a good income, but need to get my high-rate credit card debt eliminated in the short term, and continue to work to be free of all credit card debt in the next 3-4 years.
